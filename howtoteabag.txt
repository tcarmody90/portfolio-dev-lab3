MATERIALS:

coffee filters
stapler
string
loose leaf tea

DIRECTIONS:

Cut the coffee filter into a rectangle.
Put your tea into the center (base your amount off of what you want in your tea bagâ€¦I read the recommended amount on my tea and use that amount).
Fold the sides over into the middle.
Set your finger in the center and then fold the two sides up onto each other.
Fold the top down and staple. Put a piece of string on before (or after) stapling.
